Hi i'm Baney64, you may remember me from such Hearthstone related content as 1-drops in Arena or Pace of the Un'Goro meta. 

Some of my favourite Hearthstone memories revolve around that classic GvG deck, Mech Mage. I havent played it in ages, so i decided to give it a try. The deck ended up much more agressive than the GvG version, cutting cards like [card]Mechanical Yeti[/card] and [/card]Archemage Antonidis[/card]. The deck plays alot like Pirate Warrior, where you replace Pirates with Mechs and weapons with burn spells.

The deck has taken me from rank 18 - 9 so far with a win-rate around 70%,  it holds its own against most of what you will find in wild.

Deck breakdown

Mech Core: The mechs that made the deck great are mostly all still here. [card]Mechwarper[/card] is broken if it sticks, and helps you curve into those 4-drops. [card]Clockwork Gnome[/card] also helps you curve out, and synergies with [card]Mana Wyrm[/card]. [card]Piloted Shredder[/card], [card]Harvest Golem[/card], [card]Spider Tank[/card] and [card]Snow Chugger[/card] are all decent at full cost but broken when combined with Mechwarper, particularly in an aggro style deck.

Snowballing: If you can get your mechs to stick, your only going to get further ahead. [card]Cogmaster[/card] is basically just as good as the pre-nerfed [card]Small-Time Buccaneer[/card], threatening serious damage from turn-1. A 3 mana 4/4 ([card]Tinkertown Technician[/card]) is suprisingly good as well. [card]Gorillabot[/card], the only post GvG mech in the deck, provides great flexibility and value (especially at 3-mana), and the fact it is a mech helps you snowball. [card]Goblin Blastmage[/card] is excellent for tempo, its great at clearing off left-over threats from the early game so your minions can go face.

Burn: Ideally, [card]Frostbolt[/card] and [card]Fireball[/card] will go face. Just these spells alone represent 18 damage, which can all be delivered by turn-5. The mechs are there to deal chip damage and control the board in the early game, but these spells often finish the fight. [card]Primordial Glyph[/card] is broken in this deck, and it can be anything from a Polymorph for that taunt minion to a game ending turn-8 [card]Pyroblast[/card].

[card]Fel Reaver[/card]: This card is nuts in this deck, especially if you can get it out on turn-4. You rarely need more than a handfull of cards (being aggro) so loosing a few or even alot doesnt matter most of the time. This card will win you games by itself.

[card]Polymorph: Boar[/card]: I teched this in as a answer to Control Shaman (with Taunt/[card]Ancestral Spirit[/card] combos), which is the only deck I felt I just couldnt beat. Its better than [card]Polymorph[/card] here as you can use it proactively for face damage and its mana cost is lower.

Other stuff i tried

Initially i built the deck around spare part generation and Archemage Antonidis, like it was in the good ol' days. This iteration had 2 Mechanical Yeti and thus alot of 4-drops. I cut Archemage as I rarely made it to the the late game. As such, the spare parts lost alot of value so i cut the Yetis too. I also had [card]Bloodmage Thalnos[/card] but its not good enogh if you draw it early, you really want those mechs.

Card Substitutions

[card]Dr. Boom[/card] - Not really needed, argueably the least important card in the deck. Its just excelent in a vacuum and the boom-bots being mechs is nice. You could basically try anything here: another Harvest Golem, [card]Sorcerers Apprentice[/card], Mechanical Yeti, Alextraza, another Fel Reaver, Bloodmage Thalnos, [card]Sneed's Old Shredder[/card] or even [card]Mimrons Head[/card].

Fel Reaver - More important to the deck than Dr. Boom but probably replacable with the same cards. Bittertide Hydra might work but its not a mech and the downside is far more punishing.

Primordial Glyph - Core to the deck. You could try [card]Dragons Breath[/card] or Pyroblast but i would think they are strictly worse.
