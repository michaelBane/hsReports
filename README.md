## [Feb 2018: Patch 10.2 in Numbers](https://articles.hsreplay.net/2018/02/14/patch-10-2-and-the-dead-of-neutral-stone/)

Strong neutral cards can be very beneficial for the game as they represent high value crafts and excellent build-around opportunities. However if too powerful, they can lead to a lack of class identity and repetitious gameplay. In late January, Blizzard announced a set of nerfs to a number neutral cards which had found their way into many decks across multiple classes.

## [Dec 2017: Quests vs. DKs vs. Leg. Weapons](https://hsreplay.net/articles/35/quests-death-knights-and-legendary-weapons-showdown)

Now that the Year of the Mammoth is in its twilight, it seems natural to ask the question of which set had the biggest impact on the meta during their respective launch windows, and what do they look like now? The following constitutes our Quests vs. Death Knights vs. Legendary Weapons showdown!

## [Nov 2017: The Keleseth Effect](https://hsreplay.net/articles/31/the-keleseth-effect)

Prince Keleseth has made its way even into the highest ranks of the meta (helped by the nerf to Druid). High-roll mechanics are something we have covered previously, but Trump probably best describes the problem with Keleseth from a design point of view. In short, the overall win rate depends heavily on early game draw luck, something the player has little control over. The following analysis aims to extract the effect of an on-curve Prince Keleseth, specifically on a per archetype basis.

## [Oct 2017: Big Priest By The Numbers](https://hsreplay.net/articles/29/big-priest-by-the-numbers)

The following article focuses on a less popular but certainly more novel archetype commonly referred to as “Big Priest”, also known as "Resurrect Priest" or even sometimes "High-roll Priest". This deck aims to summon and resurrect big minions in the early game using Barnes and the newly introduced Priest spells Shadow Essence and Eternal Servitude.

## [Sep 2017: Deep Dive into Spreading Plague](https://hsreplay.net/articles/28/deep-dive-into-spreading-plague)

A little over a week ago the community reached out and asked us to look at the power level of a controversial card, Spreading Plague. The ask was fairly straight forward, and it provides a roadmap for the following article. To quote from the title:

Hi HSReplay.net! Can you use your data to show how much damage does Spreading Plague soak on average, and compare it with other great anti-aggro cards like Sludge Belcher or Spikeridged Steed? That would be a really interesting point to start a discussion about the potential nerf.

## [Aug 2017: Charting Meta Diversity](https://hsreplay.net/articles/26/tracking-diversity-in-the-hearthstone-meta) 

Theres something special about those first few days of a new expansion. With new sets come new possibilities, everyone is trying new stuff and your opponents deck could contain anything! Deck and card diversity in a meta is intrinsically linked to the quality of the play experience. Lower diversity leads to staleness as players grow tired of replaying the same or similar match-ups.

In the following article, we borrow concepts from ecological science of all things to track diversity in the cards that people queue up with. We analyzed over 3.75 Billion cards included in decks from uploaded replays starting in late January of 2017 through today. This leads us to presenting a first purely objective insight into how players ‘work out’ the meta and congregate toward common play-styles.

## [Jul 2017: Just for Fun - Top Includes at Rank Floors](https://hsreplay.net/articles/17/just-for-fun-top-includes-at-rank-floors) 

In February 2017, Blizzard introduced the ranked floors feature, which prevent players from de-leveling once they reach ranks 15, 10 and 5. In theory, this was intended to give players a chance to temporarily de-prioritize win-rate, take a break from the ladder grind and play something a little less serious. In the article, we compare inclusion rates of cards at ranked floors to those at grind ranks, with the intention of uncovering the cards and decks players play "just for fun", when ranking up doesn't matter.

## [Jun 2017: Deep-Dive into Curious Glimmerroot](https://hsreplay.net/articles/16/deep-dive-into-curious-glimerroot)

Curious Glimmerroot is one of the most unique cards in the Journey to Un'Goro expansion. With it comes a completely new mechanic; a mini-game of sorts, that has the player guess something about their opponent's deck.

With such uniqueness comes unique opportunities to dive into the fun statistics surrounding it. So without further ado, let's now take a look at the card's battlecry.

## [May 2017: Introducing Burn/Mech Mage](http://www.hearthpwn.com/decks/838944-70-wr-burn-mech-mage-guide)

Some of my favourite Hearthstone memories revolve around that classic GvG deck, Mech Mage. I haven't played it in ages, so i decided to give it a try. The deck ended up much more aggressive than the GvG version, cutting cards like Mechanical Yeti and Archmage Antonidas. The deck plays a lot like Pirate Warrior, where you replace Pirates with Mechs and weapons with burn spells.

The deck has taken me from rank 18 - 9 so far with a win-rate around 70%, it holds its own against most of what you will find in wild.

## [May 2017: Pace of the Meta](https://hsreplay.net/articles/14/pace-of-the-meta-ungoro-vs-gadgetzan)

The year of the Kraken will undoubtedly be remembered for being a year dominated by aggressive strategies. But with the heavy nerf of Aggro Shaman in patch 7.1, the rotation of three sets from Standard and the release of Journey to Un'Goro, many have speculated on the current pace of the meta. Many have suggested it feels slower.

So have Blizzard, really delivered the fabled "Control Meta"? To answer this question, we compared 67 million replays played in February (patch 7.0, MSG pre-nerf), March (patch 7.1, MSG post-nerf) and April (patch 8.0, UNG) of 2017, to identify whether the turn at which the game ends (concede or defeat) has really changed between patches.

## [Apr 2017: The Best Quests](https://rawgit.com/michaelBane/hsReports/master/HS04_Quests/quests.html)

One of the most anticipated features of the newly released Journey to Ongoro expansion has been the set of new legendary quest. These 1-cost spells that start in your hand provide each class with a specific objective, with the promise of epic rewards should you satisfy it. Now that we are finally able to play with the cards, its fair to say they have been pretty popular. But are they good? And how are people taking advantage of the mechanics? To find out, we analyses 170M replays, with a view to uncovering which quests are best, and which cards are best in quest-decks.

## [Mar 2017: Shaking Up the Meta - Patch 7.1](https://hsreplay.net/articles/5/shaking-meta-patch-71-numbers)

In early February, [Blizzard announced changes](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/5u1ues/upcoming_balance_and_ranked_play_changes/?ref=search_posts) to two cards considered by the community to be among the most powerful in the standard set. In this article, we analyse over 1M STB destructions and 50M cards played in the days just prior and after patch 7.1 (2017-02-28). We aim to provide a first-look into the imediate effect the nerfs have had on the meta, and how players interactions with the nerfed cards changed.

## [Feb 2017: Mulligan Luck in the Arena](https://hsreplay.net/articles/4/mulligan-luck-arena)

The luck of the draw is an inherent part of any CCG, and its what makes every game feel fresh. However some have raised concerns that too much of a games variance is determined by factors decided in the mulligan stage, such as who goes first and whether they curve out. The following article looks at the effect on win-rate of getting lucky. We use replay data (280k matches from Jan, 2017) to measure the effect of what we define as “mulligan luck”

## About me

In collaboration with [HSReplay.net](https://hsreplay.net), I build [Redshift queries](https://github.com/HearthSim/hsredshift) for extracting insight from replay data, and write articles about them. Yes i know i have too much time on my hands... You can find the articles [here](https://hsreplay.net/articles/) first, this is more a place for my 'heavier' visualizations which don't really work at scale, as well as articles which go unpublished.

Please consider [downloading the deck tracker](https://hsreplay.net) or [donating to Hearthsim](https://github.com/HearthSim/HSTracker) if wish to contribute to the project (I am not financially affiliated with HSReplay).
